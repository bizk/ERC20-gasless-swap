I need to build a Dex swapp app for a challenge for cryptocurrencies coins. It should be modern, simple and clean. Do not implement other features than what requested.

Features:

- Swapp screen - Display the selection of tokens and amount that wants to be swaped. Once calculated, display the amount of the fees. And a continue button.
- Token selection - When the user wants to select a token, display a list with thje token names and its cons, allow them to select any and reflect the user decission in the main swap screen.
- Connecting wallet - Ask user to connect metamask wallet if not connected when it clicks continues-
- Contract signing call - Leave a place holder after the account was connected to trigger the signature
- Success screen - If signing completed, show a success screen with the information that comes from the backend as the amount, coins, addresses involved, date and block explorer url.
